# Healthband
This is a Simulation project.
The Health Band can be used to detect a persons health by monitoring their heart beat and temperature. It will be useful for aged, sick, recently discharged patients and people and women. In case of Emergency the location can be sebt from the band to the registered mobile number.
When a person discharged from hospital after heart surgery the major vital sign of the person is heart beat, so the patients condition be monitored by their family members and hospitals.
When a person gets fear or attacked by someone their heart beat and temperature will increase with the help of this band we can detect such emergency situations.
As it only indicates the emergency situations and it can be deseigned as like a watch it does not affect the health.
